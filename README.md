# nano-for-mac
a Compiled version of the latest version of nano with syntax highlighting for Apple Mac OS Sillicon (ARM 64)

# WHY?!

Because the mac comes with pico (nano is a symlink to pico) which is a bit old and has no syntax highlighting.

This, I will try to keep it as updated as often as possible. Right now compiled version is 8.4
